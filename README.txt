Description:
The changing weather conditions affect the daily lives of people living in Australia. When the weather changes, most people may catch common diseases like common cold, flu and other diseases.

The common belief of residents in Australia is that the weather changes drastically in a matter of seconds. They believe the weather conditions are not stable. But most of these individuals make a claim about the unpredictability of the weather without any evidence to show for it. It is uncertain if the horrible weather conditions are just extreme cases or not.

In short, we can not make the claim that the weather condition in Australia is unpredictable without any statistical evidence to prove it.
